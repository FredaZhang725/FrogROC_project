# FrogROC_project

Mini Project 1 – Identification of the Regenerative Organizing Cell (ROC) in Xenopus tail using single-cell RNA-seq.  
This project processes scRNA-seq data with Scanpy, performs PCA, Leiden clustering, and identifies Cluster 5 as the ROC population.  
Key marker genes (*col2a1.L*, *col9a1.L*, *lect1.L*) were compared against Supplementary Table 3 from the reference paper.  
The analysis confirms that ROC-associated genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling were successfully reproduced.  

##  Data Access
